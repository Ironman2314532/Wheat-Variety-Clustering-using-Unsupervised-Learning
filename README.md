# Wheat-Variety-Clustering-using-Unsupervised-Learning

This README.md file explains how to run the code. This code is written in Google Colab. I have used K-means clustering as well as Principle Component Analysis for clustering of types of wheat.

## Usage

1. Download seeds_dataset.txt file. Dataset taken from: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F62R.
3. Open the seeds_type_clustering.ipynb file in Google Colab.
4. Save the file as your own notebook.
5. In the Files section in Colab, drag and drop the seeds_dataset.txt file.
6. Run all sections of the code and see results for each method.
